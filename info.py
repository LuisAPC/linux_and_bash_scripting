----------Introduction to Bash Scripting:------------------
What is Bash?
    A shell language
    Bourne Again Shell
    Easy commands
Why learn Bash?
    Most used shell
    Stands the test of time
    Comes with Linux and other OS
Why not Bash?
    Lacks features
    No OOP
    Difficult syntax compared to Python
    Newer tools like Ansible
Still useful
    Lightweight and always available
    Is not mutually exclusive
    Basic Knowledge makes big difference

Will use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
(Write every command in terminal from ubuntu)

Basic commands-----------------------------------------
echo: displays text you pass as an argument
    echo hello
cat: displays content of a file
        But first we need to create a file:
        vim textfile.txt
            press i to enter insert mode
            type whatever you want
            pres esc to go back to command mode
            :w
                to write the file and save changes
                :q
                    to exit file
                    or just do :wq
                    :q! to exit without saving changes
    cat textfile.txt

Writing your first bash script------------------------------
